# Joshua Evangelista Daily Journal
Week 1 - Worked as a group to develop MVP, wireframe, Docker containers configured and built. Created Gitlab board and issues.

Week 2 - Worked as group to develop FastApi framework, by this point we had a more clear vision and hammered out the details of our mvp to begin working out the CRUD and queries.

Week 3 - An auth filled week, finally ironed out all the corners and could considered auth to be completed. Last 2 days of the week I began to write the endpoints for checklist creation.

Spring Break - Dates are a little hazy in this area, I had travelled to texas for the week to study and continue building here and there. I realized how much I missed my monitor setup at home as working out of a 16‚Äù MacBook Pro and iPad (as a second monitor) was not the life for me lol.  I ended up finishing the first iteration of FE checklist list, edit, delete.

4/17 - Edited some backend schema for checklist to be more consistent with our wireframe as well as planning out the FE to inherit styling from its parent page of service

4/18 - I was in and out of class, I took lecture from the airport, missed mid-day token since I was in the air, caught up with my team at the end of the day to see progress.

4/19 - Checklist BE buttoned up, FE was starting to be established

4/20 - Began driving through deployment setup, we got to step 3 where we had to input the DATABASEURL and set up cap rover settings as well as the variables in gitlab. Checklist creation has been completed on FE.

4/24 - Was hoping to wrap up deployment today, Dido thank you became our theme of the week., checklist LIST, and checklist DELETE committed over the weekend.

4/25 - More deployment, Nick took driver seat and we started entering the DB url in our project.

4/26 - Finalllllly tied up deployment, debugging begins, page testing.

4/27 - final journal, further testing on full page, updated favicon, got image to render on hero page, and made button size for checklist consistent with edits and deletes.
