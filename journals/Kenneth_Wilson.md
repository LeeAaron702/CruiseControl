# History of Cruise Control

Week 1 - Worked as a group to develop our MVP. Once the MVP was decided, we set up the Docker files, gitlab repo and started working on the wireframe

Week 2 - Worked as a group to finish our wireframing. We started developing our schemas and writing some sample data to test the backend with FastApi.

Week 3 - Worked on Auth as a group. It took most of the week but we did it! Once that was done, I wrote a couple of quieries for services and 2 endpoints for Services.

Week 4 -  Spring Break. 

Week 5 - Started working on depolyment as a group. It was pretty strenuous but the group got through it and we are deployed.

Week 6 - Started cleaning up some code on the app. 

4/27 - Created get_client and get_all_clients endpoints and ClientInfoParent.js, ClientEdit.js and ClientInfo.js for the Frontend to get the clients account information.
